# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Environment Setup

1. Backend (Python)
   - Python 3.8+
   - Virtual environment management
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Configure environment variables

2. Frontend
   - Node.js environment
   - Package management with npm/yarn
   - Development server configuration
   - Build and deployment scripts

## Development Process

1. Feature Development
   - Create feature branch from main
   - Implement backend changes first
   - Update API contract if needed
   - Implement frontend changes
   - Write tests for both components

2. Testing Requirements
   - Unit tests for all new features
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Frontend component testing
   - End-to-end testing for critical flows

3. Code Quality
   - Follow language-specific linting rules
   - Maintain consistent code formatting
   - Document complex logic
   - Review code coverage

## Deployment Pipeline

1. Local Development
   - Run backend server
   - Run frontend development server
   - Use local database
   - Mock external services

2. Testing Environment
   - Automated deployment
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security scanning

3. Production
   - Version tagging
   - Deployment automation
   - Monitoring setup
   - Backup procedures

## Best Practices

1. Code Organization
   - Modular architecture
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent file naming
   - Proper documentation

2. Git Workflow
   - Meaningful commit messages
   - Regular small commits
   - Feature branch strategy
   - Pull request reviews

3. Error Handling
   - Consistent error patterns
   - Proper logging
   - Error reporting
   - Recovery procedures
